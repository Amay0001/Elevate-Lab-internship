# Network Scan & Vulnerability Assessment – Kali Linux
This project documents a basic workflow for scanning a local network, identifying open ports, and assessing potential security risks using Kali Linux tools like `nmap`, `wireshark`, and `nikto`.

What It Does
- Discovers active hosts in your subnet
- Identifies open TCP ports and running services
- Captures and analyzes network traffic (optional)
- Maps common services to their ports
- Detects known vulnerabilities on exposed services

 Tools Used
- `ip a` – to find your local IP range
- `nmap` – for SYN scans, service detection, and vulnerability checks
- `wireshark` / `tshark` – for packet capture and analysis
- `nikto` – for web server vulnerability scanning
